## About

Our application is a robust Flask web app that emphasizes both functionality and user experience. The application includes authentication features (login, logout, sign-up), and a notes feature, where authenticated users can add and delete personal notes.

## Technology Stack

The application is built with:
- Python: A popular high-level programming language known for its easy readability and vast library support.
- Flask: A lightweight and robust Python web framework used for developing web applications.
- JavaScript: A versatile language for creating interactive web elements.
- HTML: The standard language for designing web pages and web applications.
- SQLAlchemy: A Python SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system that provides a full suite of well-known enterprise-level persistence patterns.
- SQLite: A C-library that provides a lightweight disk-based database allowing for a standalone, zero-configuration database engine.
